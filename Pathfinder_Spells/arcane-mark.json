	"description" : "Inscribe your personal rune or mark, which consists of no more than 6 characters. Writing may be visible or invisible. May write on any substance without damaging it. \\textit{Detect magic, see invisibility, true seeing, read magic}, a \\textit{gem of seeing} or a \\textit{robe of eyes} allows an invisible mark to be seen. Mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an \\textit{erase} spell. If placed on a living being, the mark gradually fades in about a month."
